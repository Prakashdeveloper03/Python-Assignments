# Lists and Tuples

1. Write a program that converts a list of characters into their corresponding ASCII values using `map()` function.
2. Write a program to calculate the sum of first 10 natural numbers using `reduce()` function.
3. Write a program using `filter()` function to filter out only even numbers from a list.
4. Make a list of 5 random numbers.
5. Use list comprehension to construct the following lists
    - ['1a', '2a', '3a', '4a']
    - ['ab', 'ac', 'ad', 'bb', 'bc', 'bd']
    - ['ab', 'ad', 'bc'], from the list created above.
    - Multiples of 10
6. Make a list of first ten letters of the alphabet, then using the slice operation do the
following operations:
   - Print the first three letters from the list
   - Print any three letters from the middle
   - Print the letters from any particular index to the end of the list
7. Write a program that creates a list ['a', 'b', 'c'] then create a tuple from that list. Now
create a tuple ('a', 'b', 'c') and then create a list from it.
8. Write a program that prompts the user to enter an alphabet. Print all the words in the
list that starts with that alphabet.
9. Write a program that prints all the consonants in a string using list comprehension.
10.  Write a program to make a quiz. Use `zip()` function to extract question into and answer
into two separate lists.
