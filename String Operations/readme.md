# String Operations
1. Write a program that takes username and PAN card number as input. Validate
the information using isX function (eg: isdigit, isalpha etc) and print the details.
2. Write a program that encrypts a message by adding a key value to every
character. (Eg: if key = 3 add 3 to every character. If character is ‘H’ add 3 to it
(ascii value of H is 8 add 3 then 8+3=11 therefore ‘K’ is a replaced character for
‘H’)
3. Write a program that uses `split()` to split multiline string.
4. Write a program to generate Abecedarian series. (str1 = “ACDEF”, str2=” end”,
your output should generate a list [Aend Cend Dend Eend Fend])
5. Write a program that accepts a string from user and redisplays the same string
after removing vowels from it.
6. Write a program that finds whether a given character is present in a string or not.
In case it is present it prints the index at which it is present. Do not use built – in
find functions to search the character.
7. Write a program that counts the occurrences of a character in a string. Do not
use built in function `count`.
8. Write a program to reverse a string.
9. Write a program to remove the characters which have odd index values of a
given string.
10.  Write a program to check whether a string is a palindrome or not.
11.  Write a program to read a name and then display it in abbreviated form like
David Johnson should be displayed as DJ.
12.  Write a python command to print
     - “hello world” as “Hello world”
     - “hello world” as “Hello World”
     - “hElLo WoRlD” as “HeLlO wOrLd”
     - “hello world” as “Hello Friends”
13.  Write a program to print two floating point numbers
     - Upto two decimal places
     - Upto two decimal places with sign
     - With no decimal places
14.  Write a program to print integers with zeros on the left of specified width.
15.  Write a program to print integers with ‘*’ on the right of specified width.
16.  Write a program to display a number in left, right and center aligned of width 10.
17.  Write a program to strip a set of characters from a string.
18.  Write a program that removes leading and trailing spaces from a string.
19.  Write a program to count the number of digits, upper case characters, lower case
characters and special characters in a given string.
20.  Write a python program to get a string made of first 2 and last 2 characters
from a given string.
